# 🌌 Star Wars Character Database

Welcome to **Sydni's Star Wars Character DB** — a fun, interactive, and visually immersive way to explore characters from the Star Wars universe!

This project started as a simple search bar assignment... but naturally, I went full Jedi and took it to hyperspace.

## 📚 Educational Purpose

This project demonstrates how to:

- Establish a connection with an external API.
- Dynamically render data to the DOM using JavaScript.
- Provide user interactions such as search, filtering, and real-time updates.
- Work with local assets like custom cursors and background video.
- Improve UI/UX using styling, animations, and event listeners.

## ✨ Features

- 🔎 **Search Functionality** – Filter characters by name in real-time.
- 🖱️ **Custom Cursors** – Baby Yoda for browsing; a green lightsaber for hover/clickable items.
- 🎥 **Background Video** – Looping Star Wars video to set the ambiance.
- 🔇 **Mute Toggle** – Click the video or press spacebar to mute/unmute audio (ignores typing inputs).
- 🎨 **Stylized Buttons** – Custom button colors and effects, styled with the Star Wars theme.
- 📁 **Character Info** – Dynamically loaded and displayed Star Wars characters from the API.
- 🚀 Automatic Crawl Fade-Out – After 40 seconds, the crawl overlay fades out smoothly, providing a seamless transition to the main content.
- 🛸 Improved Modal Interaction – The intro modal now closes automatically after the crawl finishes, with smooth fade-out effects.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
